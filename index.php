Key Cost Drivers

Payment integrations (Stripe Connect escrow + MP fallback are tricky, especially with refunds + splits).

Real-time streaming fixes (viewer count, presence rules, moderation).

AWS Rekognition & SNS + Firebase push (must be tested with real cases).

Admin panel enhancements (auditing, CSV exports, commission configs).

Security & rate limiting (important for compliance).

Final production validation with real transactions.
